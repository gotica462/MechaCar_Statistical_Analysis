# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

To review thje production data for AutosRUs/ newest prototyp, the MechaCar, and give insights that may help the manufacturing team by doing statistical analysis like:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Using The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset that contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars, and using R studio, we created a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables such as vehicle lenght, vehicle weight, spoiler angle and ground clearance and AWD. 

See below for the results of our multiple linear model

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Based on our results, the varaibles ground clearance, vehicle length, and intercept provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset since their p-value is less than 0.05. Therefore,they are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. 

 -Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
 
No, the slope of our lineal model is not zero. Because our p-value = 5.35 x 10*-11) which is much smaller than the significance level of 0.05. So there is enough evidence to reject or null hypothesis. 
            
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

Yes, it does predcit the mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively, because its r-value is greater than 0.7 (our it's 0.7149) and that indicates a strong correlation.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

We used the MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset, in which  the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots, and created a summary statistics table using our knowledge of R.

See below for the results of the suspension coil’s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots

See below for the reslts for PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
