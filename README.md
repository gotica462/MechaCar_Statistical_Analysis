# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Overview

To review thje production data for AutosRUs/ newest prototyp, the MechaCar, and give insights that may help the manufacturing team by doing statistical analysis like:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Using The MechaCar_mpg.csv dataset that contains mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars, and using R studio, we created a linear model that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes using several variables such as vehicle lenght, vehicle weight, spoiler angle and ground clearance and AWD. 

See below for the results of our multiple linear model
